    <supports>Sacred Oath</supports>
    <description>
      <p>The Oath of Chaos is sworn to the ideals of freedom, to blaze a trail, make your own destiny and carve out your place in the world. The paladins who swear this oath dedicate themselves to creating and taking opportunities. These paladins are the trailblazers of the chaotic tides of innovation. Paladins who swear this oath are rarely members of an order of knighthood in service to a nation or a sovereign, and tend to avoid anything that ties them down.</p>
      <h5>TENETS OF CHAOS</h5>
      <p>The tenets of the Oath of Chaos are often set by the individual who takes the oath, but usually involve the following:</p>
      <p class="indent">
        <b>
          <i>Choice.</i>
        </b> The ability to choose one's destiny is paramount, and must be respected.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        <b>
          <i>Freedom.</i>
        </b> You must not spend your life at the whims of others, and act for yourself.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        <b>
          <i>Responsibility.</i>
        </b> You must deal with the consequences of your actions, and you are responsible for fulfilling your duties and obligations.
